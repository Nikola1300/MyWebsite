						<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
						<p> My name is Nikola Trajanovski, but most people call me Niko. 
							Some of my interestes are programming, cybersecurity, all types of sports 
							and physical activity in general. I am crrenty a senior year student 
							attending Southern Illinois University. I'm also part of the SIU swim team,
							which means I spend most of my time in and around the pool.
						</p>
						<p>
							I made this website because I'm excited to share my projects,
							passions, and ideas with you—enjoy exploring!

				<div class="about-content">

					<p><span>>>></span>	I am a senior undergraduate student at Southern Illinois University with a strong interest in software development and cybersecurity. My primary focus is on programming and algorithms, and I enjoy understanding how systems work at a low level—both to build efficient solutions and to identify potential weaknesses.

						I am actively preparing to start a career in software engineering or cybersecurity analysis, where I can apply problem-solving skills, analytical thinking, and a continuous learning mindset. I enjoy working with code, exploring system design, and improving performance and security through well-structured logic.
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>>>></span>Outside of my professional aspirations, I have a strong interest in cars and enjoy working on them, which aligns with my hands-on approach to problem solving. I am also a pet lover and value balance outside of academics through personal projects, learning new tools, and staying curious about emerging technologies.

					<p> <span>>>></span>
						File Type Identifier - C, Linux
						➢ Developed a Linux command-line file type identification tool in
						C that analyzes file headers using magic numbers (hexadecimal
						signatures) to determine true file formats independently of file
						extensions
					</p>
					<p><span>>>></span>
						Algorithmic
						➢ Analyzed and compared Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort,
						evaluating time and space complexity across best, average, and
						worst cases to identify performance tradeoffs.
						➢ Developed and compared an analysis of self-balancing binary
						search trees. The evaluation consisted of AVL trees, Red-Black
						trees, and Splay trees based on balancing strategies, rotation
						behavior, and operational performance. The project examined
						insertion, deletion, and lookup complexity, highlighting
						tradeoffs between strict balancing, amortized performance, and
						real-world efficiency under different access patterns.
